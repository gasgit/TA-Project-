# Countdown Letters Game Solver


## Background


## Words list

## Python script
My script is in the files [anagramSolver.py](anagramSolver.py) in this repository and it works as follows.
The most important section is:

## Preprocessing
My script does a lot of preprocessing, which only needs to be run once.
Once the preprocessing is done we can run the game solver again and again without that overhead.

## Efficiency
Here's some stuff about how efficient my code is, including an analysis of how many calculations my algorithm requires.

## Results
My script runs very quickly, and certainly within the 30 seconds allowed in the Coutdown letters game.
